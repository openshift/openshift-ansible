# This NetworkManager dispatcher script replicates the functionality of
# NetworkManager's dns=dnsmasq  however, rather than hardcoding the listening
# address and /etc/resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1 it pulls the IP address from the
# interface that owns the default route. This enables us to then configure pods
# to use this IP address as their only resolver, where as using 127.0.0.1 inside
# a pod would fail.
#
# To use this,
# - If this host is also a master, reconfigure master dnsConfig to listen on
#   8053 to avoid conflicts on port 53 and open port 8053 in the firewall
# - Drop this script in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/
# - systemctl restart NetworkManager
# - Configure node-config.yaml to set dnsIP: to the ip address of this
#   node
#
# Test it:
# host kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
# host google.com
#
# TODO: I think this would be easy to add as a config option in NetworkManager
# natively, look at hacking that up
