# This role task file is responsible for user/system account creation,
# and ensuring correct access is provided as required.

# TODO: This is currently not idempotent, bug report will be filed
# after this. Currently this task will return 'changed' if it just
# created a user, updated a user, or doesn't modify a user at
# all. Seems to be failing some kind of 'does it need updating' test
# condition and running the replace command regardless.
