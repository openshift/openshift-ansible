# When we update package "a-${version}" and a requires b >= ${version} if we
# don't specify the version of b yum will choose the latest version of b
# available and the whole set of dependencies end up at the latest version.
# Since the package module, unlike the yum module, doesn't flatten a list
# of packages into one transaction we need to do that explicitly. The ansible
# core team tells us not to rely on yum module transaction flattening anyway.

# TODO: If the sdn package isn't already installed this will install it, we
# should fix that
