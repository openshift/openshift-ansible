# 2. migrate v2 datadir into v3:
#   ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl migrate  --data-dir=${data_dir} --no-ttl
#   backup the etcd datadir first
#   Provide a way for an operator to specify transformer

# 3. re-configure OpenShift master at /etc/origin/master/master-config.yml
#   set storage-backend to “etcd3”
# 4. we could leave the master restart to current logic (there is already the code ready (single vs. HA master))

# Run
# etcdctl --cert-file /etc/etcd/peer.crt --key-file /etc/etcd/peer.key --ca-file /etc/etcd/ca.crt --endpoint https://172.16.186.45:2379 cluster-health
# to check the cluster health (from the etcdctl.sh aliases file)

# Another assumption:
# - in order to migrate all etcd v2 data into v3, we need to shut down the cluster (let's verify that on Wednesday meeting)
