## The purpose of this task file is to get a patch that is based on the diff
##  between configmap_current_file and configmap_new_file. The module
##  logging_patch takes the paths of two files to compare and also a list of
##  variables whose line we exclude from the diffs.
##  We then patch the new configmap file so that we can build a configmap
##  using that file later. We then use oc apply to idempotenly modify any
##  existing configmap.

## The following variables are expected to be provided when including this task:
# __configmap_output         -- This is provided to us from patch_configmap_files.yaml
#                                it is a dict of the configmap where configmap_current_file exists
# configmap_current_file     -- The name of the data file in the __configmap_output
# configmap_new_file         -- The path to the file that we intend to oc apply later
#                                we apply our generated patch to this file.
# configmap_protected_lines  -- The list of variables to exclude from the diff
