      Starting in 3.6 openshift_use_dnsmasq must be true or critical features
      will not function. This also means that NetworkManager must be installed
      enabled and responsible for management of the primary interface.

  fail:
    msg: |-
      Using a storage kind of 'dynamic' without enabling dynamic provisioning nor
      setting a cloud provider will cause generated PVCs to not be able to bind as
      intended. Either update to not use a dynamic storage or set
      openshift_master_dynamic_provisioning_enabled to True and set an
      openshift_cloudprovider_kind. You can disable this check with
      'dynamic_volumes_check=False'.
