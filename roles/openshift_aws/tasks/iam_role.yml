# Instance profiles consist of two parts. The first part is creating a role
# in which the instance has access and will use this role's permissions
# to make API calls on his behalf.  This role requires a trust policy
# which links a service (ec2) to the role.  This states that this role
# has access to make call ec2 API calls.
# See ../files/trustpolicy.json
#
# Currently openshift-node requires
# access to the AWS API to call describeinstances.
