oVirt Virtual Machine Infrastructure
====================================

The `oVirt.vm-infra` role manages the virtual machine infrastructure in oVirt.
This role also creates inventory of created virtual machines it defines if
`ovirt_vm_infra_wait_for_ip` is set to `true`. All defined virtual machine are part of `ovirt_vm`
inventory group. Role also create `ovirt_tag_{tag_name}` groups if there are any
tags assigned to the virtual machine and place all virtual machine with that tag
to that inventory group.

For example for following variable structure:

```yaml
ovirt_vm_infra_vms:
  - name: myvm1
    tag: mytag1
    profile: myprofile

  - name: myvm2
    tag: mytag2
    profile: myprofile
```

The role will create inventory groups `ovirt_vm` where will be both virtual
machines `myvm1` and `myvm2`. The role also create inventory groups `ovirt_tag_mytag1`
with virtual machine `myvm1` and inventory group `ovirt_tag_mytag2` with virtual
machine `myvm2`.

Requirements
------------

 * Ansible version 2.5 or higher
 * Python SDK version 4.2 or higher
