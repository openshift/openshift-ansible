# This is called if tasks with the tag 'pre_upgrade' would be executed
# This role ensures that the libselinux-python package is installed instead of
# making it a dependency/requirement.
# It relies on the fact 'openshift.common.is_containerized' to be set by
# openshift_facts instead of discovering it here. It seems that all these
# tasks have the same 'when: not openshift.common.is_containerized' which probably
# could be moved up to the originating role call. Also other tasks can be
# combined into blocks with common 'when' statements.

# TODO: Add flag for enabling EPEL repo, default to false

# TODO: Add subscription-management config, with parameters
#       for username, password, poolid(name), and official repos to
#       enable/disable. Might need to make a module that extends the
#       subscription management module to take a poolid and enable/disable the
#       proper repos correctly.
