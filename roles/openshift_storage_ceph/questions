- sequencing for the mon and the keys in configmap:

1. ansible can create the keys and put them in configMap
2. inside the container we fetch configmap for the keys

selinux issues if we run the deployment of the rest of the mons via manager?
not possible to run selinux command on the host so I think we need to deploy 3 mons and 1 mgr from the get go
