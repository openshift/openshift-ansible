# This is an example of a bring your own (byo) host inventory for a cluster
# with natively hosted, containerized GlusterFS storage for applications. It
# will also autmatically create a StorageClass for this purpose.
#
# This inventory may be used with the byo/config.yml playbook to deploy a new
# cluster with GlusterFS storage.
#
# This inventory may also be used with byo/openshift-glusterfs/config.yml to
# deploy GlusterFS storage on an existing cluster.
#
# There are additional configuration parameters that can be specified to
# control the deployment and state of a GlusterFS cluster. Please see the
# documentation in playbooks/byo/openshift-glusterfs/README.md and
# roles/openshift_storage_glusterfs/README.md for additional details.

# GlusterFS storage. These block devices must be bare (e.g. have no data, not
# be marked as LVM PVs), and will be formatted.
