# This is an example of an OpenShift-Ansible host inventory for a cluster
# with natively hosted, containerized GlusterFS storage for exclusive use
# as storage for a natively hosted Docker registry.
#
# This inventory may be used with the deploy_cluster.yml playbook to deploy a new
# cluster with GlusterFS storage, which will use that storage to create a
# volume that will provide backend storage for a hosted Docker registry.
#
# This inventory may also be used with openshift-glusterfs/registry.yml to
# deploy GlusterFS storage on an existing cluster. With this playbook, the
# registry backend volume will be created but the administrator must then
# either deploy a hosted registry or change an existing hosted registry to use
# that volume.
#
# There are additional configuration parameters that can be specified to
# control the deployment and state of a GlusterFS cluster. Please see the
# documentation in playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/README.md and
# roles/openshift_storage_glusterfs/README.md for additional details.
