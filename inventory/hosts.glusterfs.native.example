# This is an example of an OpenShift-Ansible host inventory for a cluster
# with natively hosted, containerized GlusterFS storage for applications. It
# will also automatically create a StorageClass for this purpose.
#
# This inventory may be used with the deploy_cluster.yml playbook to deploy a new
# cluster with GlusterFS storage.
#
# This inventory may also be used with openshift-glusterfs/config.yml to
# deploy GlusterFS storage on an existing cluster.
#
# There are additional configuration parameters that can be specified to
# control the deployment and state of a GlusterFS cluster. Please see the
# documentation in playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/README.md and
# roles/openshift_storage_glusterfs/README.md for additional details.

# Specify the glusterfs group, which contains the nodes that will host
# GlusterFS storage pods. At a minimum, each node must have a
# "glusterfs_devices" variable defined. This variable is a list of block
# devices the node will have access to that is intended solely for use as
# GlusterFS storage. These block devices must be bare (e.g. have no data, not
# be marked as LVM PVs), and will be formatted.
