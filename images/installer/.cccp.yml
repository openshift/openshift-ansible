# This is for the purpose of building containers on the CentOS Community Container
# Pipeline. The containers are built, tested and delivered to registry.centos.org and
# lifecycled as well. A corresponding entry must exist in the container index itself,
# located at https://github.com/CentOS/container-index/tree/master/index.d
# You can know more at the following links:
