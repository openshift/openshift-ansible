        Press CTRL+C and A to abort playbook execution. You may
        continue by pressing ENTER but the playbook will stop
        executing after this system has been restarted and services
        must be verified manually. To only restart services, set
        openshift_master_rolling_restart_mode=services in host
        inventory and relaunch the playbook.
