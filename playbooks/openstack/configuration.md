# Configuration

The majority of the configuration is handled through an Ansible inventory
directory. A sample inventory can be found at
`openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/sample-inventory/`.

`inventory/group_vars/all.yml` is used for OpenStack configuration,
while `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml` is used for OpenShift
configuration.

Environment variables may also be used.

## OpenStack Configuration

In `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_keypair_name` OpenStack keypair to use.
* Role Node Counts
  * `openshift_openstack_num_masters` Number of master nodes to create.
  * `openshift_openstack_num_infra` Number of infra nodes to create.
  * `openshift_openstack_num_nodes` Number of app nodes to create.
* Role Images
  * `openshift_openstack_default_image_name` OpenStack image used by all VMs, unless a particular role image name is specified.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_node_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_image_name`
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_image_name`
* Role Flavors
  * `openshift_openstack_default_flavor` OpenStack flavor used by all VMs, unless a particular role flavor name is specified.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_node_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_flavor`
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_flavor`
* Role Hostnames: used for customizing public names of Nova servers provisioned with a given role.
  * `openshift_openstack_master_hostname` Defaults to `master`.
  * `openshift_openstack_infra_hostname` Defaults to `infra-node`.
  * `openshift_openstack_cns_hostname` Defaults to `cns`.
  * `openshift_openstack_node_hostname` Defaults to `app-node`.
  * `openshift_openstack_lb_hostname` Defaults to `lb`.
  * `openshift_openstack_etcd_hostname` Defaults to `etcd`.
* `openshift_openstack_external_network_name` OpenStack network providing external connectivity.
* `openshift_openstack_cluster_node_labels` Custom labels for openshift cluster node groups; currently supports app and infra node groups.
The default value of this variable sets `region: primary` to app nodes and `region: infra` to infra nodes. An example of setting a customized label:

```
openshift_openstack_cluster_node_labels:
  app:
    mylabel: myvalue
```

* `openshift_openstack_provision_user_commands` Allows users to execute shell commands via cloud-init for all of the created Nova servers in the Heat stack, before they are available for SSH connections. Note that you should use [custom Ansible playbooks](./post-install.md#run-custom-post-provision-actions) whenever possible. User specified shell commands for cloud-init need to be either strings or lists:

```
- openshift_openstack_provision_user_commands:
  - set -vx
  - systemctl stop sshd # fences off ansible playbooks as we want to reboot later
  - ['echo', 'foo', '>', '/tmp/foo']
  - [ ls, /tmp/foo, '||', true ]
  - reboot # unfences ansible playbooks to continue after reboot
```

* `openshift_openstack_nodes_to_remove` The numerical indexes of app nodes that should be removed; for example, `['0', '2']`,
* Role Docker Volume Size
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_volume_size` Default Docker volume size used by all VMs, unless a particular role Docker volume size is specified. If `openshift_openstack_ephemeral_volumes` is set to `true`, the `*_volume_size` variables will be ignored and the deployment will not create any cinder volumes.
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_master_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_infra_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_cns_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_node_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_etcd_volume_size`
  * `openshift_openstack_docker_lb_volume_size`
* `openshift_openstack_flat_secgrp` Set to True if you experience issues with sec group rules quotas. It trades security for number of rules, by sharing the same set of firewall rules for master, node, etcd and infra nodes.
* Extra Role Security Group Rules: empty by default, these can be set if you'd like to add extra security group rules to your roles.
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_common_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_master_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_etcd_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_node_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_infra_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_cns_secgroup_rules`
  * `openshift_openstack_extra_lb_secgroup_rules`
* `openshift_openstack_required_packages` List of additional prerequisite packages to be installed before deploying an OpenShift cluster.


## OpenShift Configuration

In `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_disable_check` List of checks to disable.
* `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` Custom entrypoint; for example, `api.openshift.example.com`. Note than an empty hostname does not work, so if your domain is `openshift.example.com` you cannot set this value to simply `openshift.example.com`.
* `openshift_deployment_type` Version of OpenShift to deploy; for example, `origin` or `openshift-enterprise`
* `openshift_master_default_subdomain`

Additional options can be found in this sample inventory:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/inventory/hosts.example


## Stack Name Configuration

By default the Heat stack created by OpenStack for the OpenShift cluster will be
named `openshift-cluster`. If you would like to use a different name then you
must set the `OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER` environment variable before running the playbooks:

```
$ export OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER=openshift.example.com
```

If you use a non-default stack name and run the openshift-ansible playbooks to update
your deployment, you must set `OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER` to your stack name to avoid errors.


## DNS Configuration

Note that the provisioning playbooks update the original Neutron subnet
created with the Heat stack to point to the configured DNS servers.
So the provisioned cluster nodes will start using those natively as
default nameservers. Technically, this allows the deployment of OpenShift
clusters without dnsmasq proxies.

In `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_clusterid` Defaults to `openshift`
* `openshift_openstack_public_dns_domain` Defaults to `example.com`

These two parameters together form the cluster's public DNS domain that all
the servers will be under; by default this domain will be `openshift.example.com`.

* `openshift_openstack_app_subdomain` Subdomain for workloads. Defaults to `apps`.

* `openshift_openstack_public_hostname_suffix` Empty by default.
* `openshift_openstack_private_hostname_suffix` Empty by default.

If you want to use two sets of hostnames for public and private/prefixed DNS
records for your externally managed public DNS server, you can specify the
`openshift_openstack_*_hostname_suffix` parameters. These suffixes are added to
the nsupdate records sent to the external DNS server. Note that the real hostnames,
Nova servers, and ansible hostnames and inventory variables are not be updated.
The deployment may be done on arbitrary named hosts with the hostnames managed by
cloud-init. Inventory hostnames will ignore these suffixes.

* `openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` List of DNS servers accessible from all the created Nova servers. These will provide the internal name resolution for your OpenShift nodes (as well as upstream name resolution for installing packages, etc.).

* `openshift_use_dnsmasq` Controls whether dnsmasq is deployed or not.By default, dnsmasq is deployed and comes as the hosts' /etc/resolv.conf file first nameserver entry that points to the local host instance of the dnsmasq daemon that in turn proxies DNS requests to the authoritative DNS server. When Network Manager is enabled for provisioned cluster nodes, which is normally the case, you should not change the defaults and always deploy dnsmasq.

* `openshift_openstack_external_nsupdate_keys` Describes an external authoritative DNS server(s) processing dynamic records updates in the public only cluster view. For example:

```
    openshift_openstack_external_nsupdate_keys:
      public:
        key_secret: <some nsupdate key>
        key_algorithm: 'hmac-md5'
        key_name: 'update-key'
        server: <public DNS server IP>
```

Here, for the public view section, we specified another key algorithm and
optional `key_name`, which normally defaults to the cluster's DNS domain.
This just illustrates a compatibility mode with a DNS service deployed
by OpenShift on OSP10 reference architecture, and used in a mixed mode with
another external DNS server.


## Kuryr Networking Configuration

Kuryr is an SDN that uses OpenStack Neutron. This prevents the double overlay
overhead one would get when running OpenShift on OpenStack using the default
OpenShift SDN.

https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/readme.html

### OpenStack Requirements

Kuryr has a few additional requirements on the underlying OpenStack deployment:

* The Trunk Ports extension must be enabled:
  * https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/admin/config-trunking.html
  * Make sure to restart `neutron-server` after you change the configuration
* Neutron must use the Open vSwitch firewall driver:
  * https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/admin/config-ovsfwdriver.html
  * Make sure to restart `neutron-openvswitch-agent` after the config change
* A Load Balancer as a Service (implementing LBaaS v2 API) must be available
  * Octavia is the only supported solution right now
  * You could try the native Neutron LBaaSv2 but it is deprecated and buggy

We recommend you use the Queens or newer release of OpenStack.


### Necessary Kuryr Options

This is is the minimum you need to set (in `group_vars/all.yml`):

```yaml
openshift_use_kuryr: true
openshift_use_openshift_sdn: false
os_sdn_network_plugin_name: cni
openshift_node_proxy_mode: userspace
openshift_hosted_manage_registry: false
use_trunk_ports: true

openshift_master_open_ports:
- service: dns tcp
  port: 53/tcp
- service: dns udp
  port: 53/udp
openshift_node_open_ports:
- service: dns tcp
  port: 53/tcp
- service: dns udp
  port: 53/udp

kuryr_openstack_public_subnet_id: <public/external subnet UUID>
```

The `kuryr_openstack_public_subnet_id` value must be set to the UUID of the
public subnet in your OpenStack. In other words, the subnet with the Floating
IP range defined. It corresponds to the public network, which is often called
`public`, `external` or `ext-net`.

**NOTE**: A lot of OpenStack deployments do not make the public subnet
accessible to regular users. We will add an option to enter the network here
instead. This issue is tracked at:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/issues/7383

### Port pooling

It is possible to pre-create Neutron ports for later use. This means that
several ports (each port will be attached to an OpenShift pod) would be created
at once. This will speed up individual pod creation at the cost of having a few
extra ports that are not currently in use.

For more information on the Kuryr port pools, check out the Kuryr
documentation:

https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/installation/ports-pool.html

To disable this feature, you must set:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_enable_pools: false
```

You can control the port pooling characteristics with these options:

```yaml
kuryr_openstack_pool_max: 0
kuryr_openstack_pool_min: 1
kuryr_openstack_pool_batch: 5
kuryr_openstack_pool_update_frequency: 20
`openshift_kuryr_precreate_subports: 5`
```

Note in the last variable you specify the number of subports that will
be created per trunk port, i.e., per pool.

In order to enable the kuryr `multi-pool` driver support, we need to tag
the nodes with their corresponding `pod_vif` labels so that the right kuryr
pool driver is used for each VM/node. To do that, uncomment:

```
openshift_openstack_cluster_node_labels:
  app:
    region: primary
    pod_vif: nested-vlan
  infra:
    region: infra
    pod_vif: nested-vlan
```


### Deploying OpenShift Registry

Since we've disabled the OpenShift registry creation, you will have to create
it manually afterwards. SSH to a master node and run this as root:

```yaml
oadm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig --service-account=registry
```

For more information (e.g. how to use a specific storage backend), please
follow the OpenShift documentation on the registry:

https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/registry/index.html


## Multi-Master Configuration

Please refer to the official documentation for the
[multi-master setup](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#multiple-masters)
and define the corresponding [inventory variables](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-cluster-variables)
in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`. For example, given a load balancer node
under the ansible group named `ext_lb`:

```
openshift_master_cluster_hostname: "{{ groups.ext_lb.0 }}"
openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname: "{{ groups.ext_lb.0 }}"
```

## Provider Network Configuration

Normally, the playbooks create a new Neutron network and subnet and attach
floating IP addresses to each node. If you have a provider network set up, this
is all unnecessary as you can just access servers that are placed in the
provider network directly.

Note that this will not update the nodes' DNS, so running openshift-ansible
right after provisioning will fail (unless you're using an external DNS server
your provider network knows about). You must make sure your nodes are able to
resolve each other by name.

In `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* `openshift_openstack_provider_network_name` Provider network name. Setting this will cause the `openshift_openstack_external_network_name` and `openshift_openstack_private_network_name` parameters to be ignored.


## OpenStack Credential Configuration

Some features require you to configure OpenStack credentials. In `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_cloudprovider_kind: openstack
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_auth_url: "{{ lookup('env','OS_AUTH_URL') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_username: "{{ lookup('env','OS_USERNAME') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_password: "{{ lookup('env','OS_PASSWORD') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_tenant_name: "{{ lookup('env','OS_PROJECT_NAME') }}"
* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_domain_name: "{{ lookup('env','OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME') }}"

For more information, consult the [Configuring for OpenStack page in the OpenShift documentation][openstack-credentials].

[openstack-credentials]: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/configuring_openstack.html#install-config-configuring-openstack

**NOTE** the OpenStack integration currently requires DNS to be configured and
running and the `openshift_hostname` variable must match the Nova server name
for each node. The cluster deployment will fail without it. If you use the
provided OpenStack dynamic inventory and configure the
`openshift_openstack_dns_nameservers` Ansible variable, this will be handled
for you.


## Cinder-Backed Persistent Volumes Configuration

In addition to [setting up OpenStack credentials](#openstack-credential-configuration),
you must set the following in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_blockstorage_version`: v2

The Block Storage version must be set to `v2`, because OpenShift does not support
the v3 API yet and the version detection currently does not work.

After a successful deployment, the cluster will be configured for Cinder persistent
volumes.

### Validation

1. Log in and create a new project (with `oc login` and `oc new-project`)
2. Create a file called `cinder-claim.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
metadata:
  name: "claim1"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "1Gi"
```
3. Run `oc create -f cinder-claim.yaml` to create the Persistent Volume Claim object in OpenShift
4. Run `oc describe pvc claim1` to verify that the claim was created and its Status is `Bound`
5. Run `openstack volume list`
   * A new volume called `kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-UUID` should be created
   * Its size should be `1`
   * It should not be attached to any server
6. Create a file called `mysql-pod.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
    - resources:
        limits :
          cpu: 0.5
      image: openshift/mysql-55-centos7
      name: mysql
      env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wp_user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wp_pass
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wp_db
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql/data
  volumes:
    - name: mysql-persistent-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: claim1
```

7. Run `oc create -f mysql-pod.yaml` to create the pod
8. Run `oc describe pod mysql`
   * Its events should show that the pod has successfully attached the volume above
   * It should show no errors
   * `openstack volume list` should show the volume attached to an OpenShift app node
   * NOTE: this can take several seconds
9. After a while, `oc get pod` should show the `mysql` pod as running
10. Run `oc delete pod mysql` to remove the pod
   * The Cinder volume should no longer be attached
11. Run `oc delete pvc claim1` to remove the volume claim
   * The Cinder volume should be deleted


## Cinder-Backed Registry Configuration

You can use a pre-existing Cinder volume for the storage of your
OpenShift registry. To do that, you need to have a Cinder volume.
You can create one by running:

```
openstack volume create --size <volume size in gb> <volume name>
```

The volume needs to have a file system created before you put it to
use.

Once the volume is created, [set up OpenStack credentials](#openstack-credential-configuration),
and then set the following in `inventory/group_vars/OSEv3.yml`:

* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind`: openstack
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_access_modes`: ['ReadWriteOnce']
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_openstack_filesystem`: xfs
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_openstack_volumeID`: e0ba2d73-d2f9-4514-a3b2-a0ced507fa05
* `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_size`: 10Gi

The **Cinder volume ID**, **filesystem** and **volume size** variables
must correspond to the values in your volume. The volume ID must be
the **UUID** of the Cinder volume, *not its name*.

The volume can also be formatted if you configure it in
`inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

* openshift_openstack_prepare_and_format_registry_volume: true

Note that formatting **will destroy any data that's currently on the volume**!

If you already have a provisioned OpenShift cluster, you can also run the
registry setup playbook directly:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/provisioning/openstack/prepare-and-format-cinder-volume.yaml
```
