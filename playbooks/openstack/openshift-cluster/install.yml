# NOTE(shadower): the AWS playbook builds an in-memory inventory of
# all the EC2 instances here. We don't need to as that's done by the
# dynamic inventory.

# TODO(shadower): the AWS playbook sets the
# `openshift_master_cluster_hostname` and `osm_custom_cors_origins`
# values here. We do it in the OSEv3 group vars. Do we need to add
# some logic here?
