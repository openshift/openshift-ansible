# Control Plane Upgrade Playbook
#
# Upgrades masters and Docker (only on standalone etcd hosts)
#
# This upgrade does not include:
# - node service running on masters
# - docker running on masters
# - node service running on dedicated nodes
#
# You can run the upgrade_nodes.yml playbook after this to upgrade these components separately.
