# For 1.4/3.4 we want to upgrade everyone to etcd-3.0. etcd docs say to
# upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.1.x to 2.2.x to 2.3.x to 3.0.x. While this is a tedius
# task for RHEL and CENTOS it's simply not possible in Fedora unless you've
# mirrored packages on your own because only the GA and latest versions are
# available in the repos. So for Fedora we'll simply skip this, sorry.
