# This is called if tasks with the tag 'pre_upgrade' would be executed
# This makes a call to openshift_facts, even though it was run in the upgrade playbook
# Although it seems it is just run against the master.  There may be a better way
# to capture what is in 'openshift.master.ha' than to use hte openshift_facts role
# -- maybe the module could be broken out for common use
