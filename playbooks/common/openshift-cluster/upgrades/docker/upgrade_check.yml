# Included from: playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/pre/verify_docker_upgrade_targets
#
# We include this if 'docker_upgrade' is not set, is false, or if we are not installing
# on atomic (openshift.common.is_atomic)
# This playbook sets | reads variables to determine if a docker upgrade is needed,
# however, given the naming convention it isn't clear where the values are set -- e.g.
# duc_retval_upgrade_needed (docker_upgrade_check) makes it clear where the value
# is set and what it tells us.

# This snippet determines if a Docker upgrade is required by checking the inventory
# variables, the available packages, and sets l_docker_upgrade to True if so.
