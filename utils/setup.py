    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development

    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    #extras_require={
    #    'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #    'test': ['coverage'],

    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
