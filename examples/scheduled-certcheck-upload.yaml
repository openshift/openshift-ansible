# An example CronJob to run a regular check of OpenShift's internal
# certificate status.
#
# Each job will upload new reports to a directory in the master hosts
#
# The Job specification is the same as 'certificate-check-upload.yaml'
# and the expected pre-configuration is equivalent.
# See that Job example and examples/README.md for more details.
