# An example ScheduledJob to run a regular check of OpenShift's internal
# certificate status.
#
# Each job will upload new reports to a directory in the master hosts
#
# The Job specification is the same as 'certificate-check-upload.yaml'
# and the expected pre-configuration is equivalent.
# See that Job example and examples/README.md for more details.
#
# NOTE: ScheduledJob has been renamed to CronJob in upstream k8s recently. At
# some point (OpenShift 3.6+) this will have to be renamed to "kind: CronJob"
# and once the API stabilizes the apiVersion will have to be updated too.
