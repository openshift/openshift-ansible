# An example Job to run a certificate check of OpenShift's internal
# certificate status from within OpenShift.
#
# The generated reports are uploaded to a location in the master
# hosts, using the playbook 'easy-mode-upload.yaml'.
#
# This example uses the openshift/origin-ansible container image.
# (see README_CONTAINER_IMAGE.md in the top level dir for more details).
#
# The following objects are expected to be configured before the creation
# of this Job:
#   - A ConfigMap named 'inventory' with a key named 'hosts' that
#     contains the the Ansible inventory file
#   - A Secret named 'sshkey' with a key named 'ssh-privatekey
#     that contains the ssh key to connect to the hosts
# (see examples/README.md for more details)
